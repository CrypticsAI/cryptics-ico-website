= Widget Areas =

1. Sidebar
2. Footer
3. Sidebar Pages (only on Pages)
4. Sidebar Custom Post Types (only on Custom Post Types)

= Blockquotes =

Blockquotes can be aligned left or right (in a similar way that images are) using the `"alignleft"` or `"alignright"` classes.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.
